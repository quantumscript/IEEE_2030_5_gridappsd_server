# GridAPPS-D IEEE 2030.5 Server

## Overview

The GridAPPS-D IEEE 2030.5 Server implements the Common Smart Inverter Profile (CSIP).  The server
can work in both in-band and out-of-band registration models detailed in  CCIP Implementation Guide v2
section 6.1.3 and 6.1.4 respectively.  

## Setup

## Installing from pypi

The recommended way to install this project from pypi is in a virtual environment.  Create a virtual environment and install
2030.5 server as follows.

```shell
# creates an environment 'env' in the current directory
python3 -m venv env

# Activate the environment in the current shell
source env/bin/activate

# Install 2030.5 server
pip install gridappsd_2030_5
```

## Configuration

The server requires two configuration files.  The first is for generation of certificates and keys for the system (openssl.cnf).  Currently
we shell out to openssl for key/cert/ca generation during runtime.  Each time the server is started up it will attempt to regenerate
key/certs/ca unless --no-create-certs is passed to the server startup method.  The second is the configuration for the server itself.  
The configuration file holds the definitions for controls, der, end devices and other settings that will be used during the runtime
of the server.

The following files, openssl.cnf and config.yml, should be placed in the same directory where the server is started from.

### Example openssl.cnf

```ini
# OpenSSL example configuration file.
# This is mostly being used for generation of certificate requests.
#

# This definition stops the following lines choking if HOME isn't
# defined.
HOME                    = .
RANDFILE                = $ENV::HOME/.rnd

# Extra OBJECT IDENTIFIER info:
#oid_file               = $ENV::HOME/.oid
oid_section             = new_oids

# To use this configuration file with the "-extfile" option of the
# "openssl x509" utility, name here the section containing the
# X.509v3 extensions to use:
# extensions            =
# (Alternatively, use a configuration file that has only
# X.509v3 extensions in its main [= default] section.)

[ new_oids ]

# We can add new OIDs in here for use by 'ca', 'req' and 'ts'.
# Add a simple OID like this:
# testoid1=1.2.3.4
# Or use config file substitution like this:
# testoid2=${testoid1}.5.6

# Policies used by the TSA examples.
tsa_policy1 = 1.2.3.4.1
tsa_policy2 = 1.2.3.4.5.6
tsa_policy3 = 1.2.3.4.5.7

  #   vRef adjustment. When enabled, the Volt-Var curve characteristic
  #   SHALL be adjusted autonomously as vRef changes and
  #   autonomousVRefTimeConstant SHALL be present. If a DER is able to
  #   support Volt-Var mode but is unable to support autonomous vRef
  #   adjustment, then the DER SHALL execute the curve without
  #   autonomous vRef adjustment. If not specified, then the value is
  #   false.

  #   then this field MAY be present. If the curveType is not

  # CurveData:
  # curveType: Specifies the associated curve-based control mode.
  # openLoopTms: Open loop response time, the time to ramp up to
  #   90% of the new target in response to the change in voltage, in
  #   hundredths of a second. Resolution is 1/100 sec. A value of 0 is
  #   used to mean no limit. When not present, the device SHOULD
  #   follow its default behavior.
  # rampDecTms: Decreasing ramp rate, interpreted as a percentage
  #   change in output capability limit per second (e.g. %setMaxW /
  #   sec).  Resolution is in hundredths of a percent/second. A value
  #   of 0 means there is no limit. If absent, ramp rate defaults to
  #   setGradW.
  # rampIncTms: Increasing ramp rate, interpreted as a percentage
  #   change in output capability limit per second (e.g. %setMaxW /
  #   sec).  Resolution is in hundredths of a percent/second. A value
  #   of 0 means there is no limit. If absent, ramp rate defaults to
  #   rampDecTms.
  # rampPT1Tms: The configuration parameter for a low-pass filter,
  #   PT1 is a time, in hundredths of a second, in which the filter
  #   will settle to 95% of a step change in the input value.

### Starting the server

After installing one can start the server by the folloing command:

```bash
2030_5_server --no-validate config.yml
```

To learn about other options please use the help module.

```bash
2030_5_server --help
```

## Installing from source

The installation requires poetry version 1.2 or greater.  <https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation>

 1. Clone the repository
 2. run `poetry install` from the root of the repository directory.

### Clone the repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/GRIDAPPSD/gridappsd-2030_5 -b develop
cd gridappsd-2030_5
```

### Install Requirements

```shell
poetry install
```

### Run the Server

```shell
usage: 2030_5_server [-h] [--no-validate] [--no-create-certs] [--debug] config

positional arguments:
  config             Configuration file for the server.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  --no-validate      Allows faster startup since the resolving of addresses for devices is not done.
  --no-create-certs  If specified certificates for for client and server will not be created.
  --debug            Put server in debug mode (more logging)
```

### Using the 2030.5 proxy

The proxy is used to keep a http 1.1 connection alive rather than doing the tls setup
more than one time.

```shell
usage: 2030_5_proxy [-h] [--debug] config

positional arguments:
  config      Configuration file for the server.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  --debug     Turns debugging on for logging of the proxy.
```

## Client Connectivity

The server will expose an endpoint of beginning with <https://myserver/dcap>.  From there
a client will be able to traverse and do any PUT, POST, GET, and DELETE operations specified
in the 2030.5 test procedures.

## Function Sets Implemented
